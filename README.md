# solarSystemSimulation
I finally got to creating a project i had wanted to do for years - making a model of the solar system.
The project is drawn out completely in code using basic trig and a line & circle drawing api you find in any decent 2d engine.
Planets can have dynamically created orbiting moons, emit light rays (like the Sun) or have rings (like Saturn).
There is pan and zoom to mouse pos implemented, and also camera follow when clicking a planet.
The biggest challenge was getting fps to reasonable performance surrounding the sun's rays. I had to play around with a number of techniques before getting something workable.
I am aware that nothing here is correct - not the number of planets, moons, distance, scaling... But this template can easily be populated with the correct heavenly bodies. This project was a-lot of fun and felt a-lot more like art than coding.
